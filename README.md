# Algorithm-Informed Neural Network (AINN)

This repository contains the official implementation of **Algorithm-Informed Neural Networks (AINNs)**, featuring three example applications:

- **Fractional Knapsack**  
- **Fall Detection**  
- **Keyword Spotting**

Each folder includes the corresponding **dataset**, **baseline models**, and all relevant **hyperparameters** and **training configurations** needed to reproduce the experiments.
